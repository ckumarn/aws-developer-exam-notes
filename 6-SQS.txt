1. What is it?
===============

-SQS is pull not push
-web service access to message queue
-distributed queue system
-decouple components of a system to run idendentadnty.
-queue is like a store
-messages up to 256KB of text any format
-queue is like a buffer
-queues resolves issues like when producer works faster than the consumer eg: stuff isnt lost of producer suddenly croaks.
-ensures delivery of each message at least once 
-supports multiple readers and writers on same queue.
-good way to scale.
-does not guarntee FIFO!
-if you need ordering, then put order info in message so your system can handle that shit.

-eg: large number of image files to encode in the queue
    -a server asynronsously pull the task message from the queue
    -retreive the named file
    -process encode etc
    -write image back to S3
    -write task complete message to another queue
    -delete the original task message
    -deletes the original task message
    -checks for more messages in teh worker queue

-messages in queue have a visiblity timeout clock.
-this visibility timeout starts once the message has been picked up!
-this is how amazon guantees the message is delivery at least once.
-so if server picks up message but then dies the visilibity timeout will expire, leaving the message on the queue.
-if server completes successfully, it should dleete the message from the queueu within the visibility timeout.

-autoscaling - groups: 

!-Exam Tips
!-SQS is not FIFI
!-12 hours visibility timeout
!-provide at least once delivery therefore make system idempotent
!-256kb message size
!-orginally 64kb
!-billing based on 64kb chunk, there 4 chunks per message
!-first 1 million is free.
!-$0.50c SQS requests / month. thereafter $0.00000050 / SQS request. 
!-single request can have 1 to 10 messages, total payload of 256kb.
!-each 64kb chunk is billed as one request
!-eg one api call of 256kb payload is billed as 4 requests.

2. More
===============

-sqs messages can delivered multiple times and in any order
-default visibility timeout is 30 seconds. 
-maximum visilibity is 12 hours.
-ChangeMessageVisibility action to change.
-long polling: 
    -saves money
    -way to retreeive messages
    -doesnt return a response if queue is empty - until the long poll timeout times out! 
    -short polling does return a response immediatly, being chanrged for each poll.
    -long poll timeout maximum is 20 seconds.
-fanning out:
    -create SNS topic
    -subscribe multiple SQS queues to the SNS topic.
    -when a message is sent to SNS topic, it gets fanned out to the SQS queues.

=====================
Summary x2
=====================

-SQS multiple times and order
-default isibility timeout is 30 seconds which is default, max is 12 hours.
-ChangeMessageVisibility action.
-long polling , max time out - 20 seconds.
-fanning - uses with SNS topic and use multiple SQS queues to subscribe to the topic.
