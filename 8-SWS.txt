===========================
1. Simple Workflow Service
===========================

-web service to coordinate work across distributed app components.
-eg: an amazon order :
-customer order -> verify order -> charge creditcard -> ship order -> warehouse shit -> delivery -> close.
-workers and deciders
-worker: program that does the shit and return result.
-decider: program that does the deciding shit. ordering, concurrency, scheduling if this then that
-workers and deciders can run on ec2 or behind firewalls
-AWF brokers interactions between workers and deciders.
-allows decidr to get consistent views into progress of tasks and initiate new tasks.
-AWF stores tasks, assigns to workers  and monitors progress.
-SWK ensures task is only assigned once, never duplicated.
-SWF maintains applictions state durably, workers and deciders dont keep track of state so they can run independantly and scale quickly.

-domain is a container of workflow and activity types.
-domain isolate a set of types , executions, and task lists from each other in the same account.
-use RegisterDomain API call
-register domain in JSON
-!max workflow can be 1 year, value is in seconds.

-!SQS vs SWF, SWF only ever done once!!!
-!SQS vs SWF, SWF max length is 1 year : SQS max time is 12 hours.
-!SQS vs SWF, SWF is task orientated API : SQS is message oriented API
